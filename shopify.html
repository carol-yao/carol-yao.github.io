      <div class="paragraph-spacing"></div>
      <p class="case-study-paragraph">The project I was given was to lay down the foundation for a <b>large scale service design project</b> that was part of a larger initiative in the Platform product line. </p>

      <h1 class="case-study-large-header">My Role</h1>
      <p class="case-study-paragraph">At Shopify, I was given a lot of responsibility, so I got the opportunity to <b>champion this service design project</b>. I conducted interviews with users, identified a key area for our team to invest resources in and facilitated a cross-team workshop in another office.</p>
      <div class="paragraph-spacing"></div>
      <p class="case-study-paragraph">After consolidating all the research and proposed solutions, I prioritized a list of key themes and major pain points. Then, I wireframed design explorations and flows to <b>set the project vision</b> and used the list of themes to determine an MVP for the project.</p>
      <div class="large-spacing"></div>
      <h1 class="case-study-large-header">The Impact</h1>
      <p class="case-study-paragraph">The team is now investing time to build out features for the problem areas I identified in my research. This service design work is reusable by many teams and will be contributing significantly to the product line’s top priority project this year.</p>

      <p class="case-study-paragraph-small-less-wide">t required a lot of research to fully understand the problem space we were exploring and how they affected our ecosystem of partners and merchants.</p>
      <p class="case-study-paragraph-title">Vague Project</p>
      <p class="case-study-paragraph-small-less-wide">This was a personal challenge but I learned to thrive in ambiguity this summer. The project was vague — there was no scope and no direction. Our only goal was to improve the speed of the process.</p>
      <p class="case-study-paragraph-title">Difficult to Measure Success</p>
      <p class="case-study-paragraph-small-less-wide">The problem space was complicated, there were many edge cases, seasonality effects and other variables—making it difficult to define success metrics.</p>

      <h1 class="case-study-large-header">Implementing the Quick Wins</h1>
      <p class="case-study-paragraph">After the workshop, I digitized the journey map, ideas from solutioning exercises and synthesized key takeaways to share across teams.</p>
      <div class="paragraph-spacing"></div>
      <p class="case-study-paragraph">I bucketed the pain points and potential solutions into quick wins and projects that required more development or UX work.</p>

      <p class="case-study-paragraph"><b>The quick wins were implemented as part of our team hack days and have already increased speed</b>.</p>
      <div class="large-spacing"></div>
      <h1 class="case-study-large-header">Synthesis and Prioritizing Themes</h1>
      <p class="case-study-paragraph">Since I had the most context on this problem, my role was to synthesize all the findings and set the future vision for the project.</p>
      <div class="paragraph-spacing"></div>
      <p class="case-study-paragraph">This was a big task.</p>
      <div class="paragraph-spacing"></div>
      <p class="case-study-paragraph">To help guide myself, I analyzed the solutions from the workshop and <b>extracted the most common themes</b> they were trying to solve for. Then, I <b>prioritized the themes based on impact, time, and risk</b>.</p>
      <div class="paragraph-spacing"></div>
      <p class="case-study-paragraph">Using this, I began my explorations.</p>
      <div class="large-spacing"></div>
      <h1 class="case-study-large-header">Solutioning and Setting the Vision</h1>
      <p class="case-study-paragraph">I explored several different solutions and flows before coming up with a proposal for the future vision. I wireframed the UI for this ideal flow and iterated on it based on feedback from users and stakeholders.</p>
      <div class="paragraph-spacing"></div>
      <p class="case-study-paragraph">Using the prioritized list of themes, I made <b>recommendations on what an MVP would look like</b>. Since I understood how the system worked through my service design research, I also noted how all the relevant teams would interact with this flow. </p>
      <div class="paragraph-spacing"></div>
      <p class="case-study-paragraph">There were many tradeoffs I had to make during my designs, so I listed the potential risks associated with my decisions to be further iterated on.</p>

      <h1 class="case-study-large-header">Learnings</h1>
      <p class="case-study-paragraph">Throughout this experience, I got to wear many different hats and learn about many things — research methods, service design, scoping out problems and running a workshop.</p>
      <div class="paragraph-spacing"></div>
      <p class="case-study-paragraph">It was a very complex problem space, so I had to learn how to consolidate a lot of information and ideas into an actionable solution. It was different than any design work I did in the past —  there was more focus on the process and laying down the groundwork for future design work. </p>
      <div class="paragraph-spacing"></div>
      <p class="case-study-paragraph">And, since I was conducting research that was useful for multiple projects across the product line, I also learned about the importance of communication. This was an area people knew little about, so it was important to create meaningful and digestible artifacts to share my work with other teams.</p>
